# Most GPSes that offer both a PPS and an NMEA (or binary) serial
# interface suffer from the problem that the serial interface is
# offset by tens to low hundreds of milliseconds and is jittery as
# all get out (the "tick" in this case being the NL at the end of
# a particular sentence).  Can't do much about the jitter, but we can
# at least put in a fudge factor (on the serial only) that will keep it
# from being such an outlying source that it immediately gets declared
# a falseticker.  40-45 milliseconds seems a good value here.  You may
# wish to tweak this as a result of observed failures in the wild, though
# chasing offsets of fewer than 4 milliseconds is doomed to be a witless
# mission.
